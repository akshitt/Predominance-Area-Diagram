The procedure of calculations have been explained in the report. This README contains steps to run the code.

Download the repository and run `script.py` by typing either of the following commands in terminal (depending on your system)<br/>
Linux `python script.py`<br/>
Linux `python3 script.py`<br/>
Windows `py script.py` <br/>

  - Enter the temperature when prompted by the code (in Kelvin)
  - Enter the filename for the plot to be saved as
  - the final plot is saved in the directory as filename.png
  
All the code can be accessed in the `MM209 Programming Assignment.ipynb` file. If running the `.ipynb` file:
  - Run all the cells in given order
  - in the last cell, type `pad(Temperature)` where `Temperature` is an integer at which you want the plot to be made
  - Run the last cell to see the plot
